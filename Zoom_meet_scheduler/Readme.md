- In this time of pandemic, when every organization is switching to zoom, google meet etc, 

- I have created this automation bot which will schedule zoom meetings as per the input given, and then it will send the generated invite link to all recipients also.

- This will help the management and will reduce their time consumption in scheduling the meetings and sending the invite links to people.

# Tech used 
- JavaScript 
- puppeteer (nodeJS)
- nodemailer (nodeJS)

# Concepts implemented
- Promises
- Async and Await
